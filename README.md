You start with no job, no home, no life goals, just a dream of one day owning 52 monthly streaming subscriptions at once. Luckily, the National Loan Office(NLO) is running a promotion: unlimited loans with no credit check.

As you borrow more, you gain prestige. As your prestige grows, so does your collection of questionable “business ventures” and ethically ambiguous hobbies. Eventually, you’ll rise from penniless nobody to full-blown Organ-Selling Warlord, feared and respected across the financial underworld.
