You start with no job, no home, no life goals, just a dream of one day owning 52 monthly streaming subscriptions at once. Luckily, the National Loan Office(NLO) is running a promotion: unlimited loans with no credit check. This seems simple and harmless at first, but once you realize the true horror, there is no going back.

As you borrow more, you gain prestige. As your prestige grows, so does your collection of questionable “business ventures” and ethically ambiguous hobbies. Eventually, you’ll rise from penniless nobody to full-blown Organ-Selling Warlord, feared and respected across the financial underworld.

Under the crushing, unrelenting weight of the NLO’s debts, you must claw your way to riches. Sell your organs. Sell your friends. Sell your family. Sell the world itself;whatever it takes to finally, gloriously, become free.
